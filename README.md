# Wonderland: A Theme Park Database Web Application

# Overview

Wonderland is a dynamic, user-friendly web application designed to manage and display a comprehensive database of theme park attractions, events, and guest services. This project is the culmination of collaborative efforts, utilizing the latest technologies to ensure a seamless and interactive user experience. By leveraging MySQL for database management, React for the front-end, and Vanilla Node.js for the backend, Wonderland offers a robust platform for theme park enthusiasts and administrators alike.

# Getting Started

To get started with Wonderland, follow the following setup instructions in the documentation. Ensure you have MySQL, Node.js, and npm installed on your system for a smooth setup process.

Open MySQL Workbench and setup to import the provided SQL dump file.

Either clone the repo, or download the ZIP file to get started.

Open the project and remain in the 'Wonderland' (root) directory.

Open your terminal and run `npm install` (this will install needed dependencies), then run `vercel dev` after (this will replicate the Vercel deployment environment locally).

You will be prompted some questions from the Vercel setup process, you may choose the deafult value for all of the prompts from it.

After Vercel finishes its setup process, the frontend and backend application will begin to run locally. You can click on the http://localhost:3001 link on the terminal
(or visit this site link on your local browser) to then visit the Wonderland application.

After that, everything should be running locally and will be good to go!

Currently, Wonderland is also deployed under the following domain: https://wonderland-seven.vercel.app/
