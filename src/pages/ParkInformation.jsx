          Making Things Work For Everyone
        </h2>
        <p>
        Here at Wonderland, we understand the importance of accessibility, which is why we've taken measures to provide inclusive 
        environments and accessible experiences for everyone. 
        From wheelchair-friendly pathways to specialized services, we're committed to making sure that all visitors
        can fully enjoy all that our park has to offer while prioritizing safety above all else.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Wheelchair Accessibility
        </h3>
        <p>
          At Wonderland, our park is wheelchair accessible, with ramps and wide pathways for easy navigation. 
          Wheelchair users can enter the park without encountering any barriers. Furthermore, some of our attractions are wheelchair accessible. 
          Please contact us at wonderlandUS@gmail.com or call (111)-111-1111 for specific accessibility information for each attraction.
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, we offer wheelchair rentals for visitors who require mobility assistance during their visit to our theme park. 
          Our wheelchairs are designed for comfort and ease of use, providing a convenient solution for visitors with mobility challenges.

          Wheelchair rentals are available at designated locations near the park entrance. 
          Our magical staff here at Wonderland will assist you in selecting the appropriate wheelchair and completing the rental process.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Service Animals
        </h3>
        <p>
          Service animals are welcome here at Wonderland under the care of their owner. However, we ask that all visitors with service animals check in with their
          service animal before entering the park. Service animals must remain under their owner’s control at all times.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Ride Requirements
        </h3>
        <p>
          Your safety is our top priority at Wonderland. 
          While our rides and attractions are designed to provide magical experiences for our visitors to enjoy, 
          it’s important to read the safety information at each attraction so that 
          you can make an informed decision about your ability to safely and conveniently experience everything that Wonderland has to offer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unless otherwise stated, visitors must be 48" or taller in order to ride most rides.
          Additionally, for most rides and attractions, visitors must be able to independently
          maintain an upright position, and brace and support your torso,
          neck, and head while absorbing sudden and dramatic movements
          throughout the experience. 
          </p>
          <p>
          Furthermore, all passenger restraint systems, including lap bars, shoulder harnesses, 
          and seat belts must be positioned and fastened properly to assure rider safety. 
          Visitors who do not fit properly within any safety restraint will not be permitted to ride. 
          As such, visitors are strongly encouraged to 
          try the test seats provided at the entrance of the attractions to ensure their ability to ride.
          </p>
          <p>
          If you have any questions, feel free to speak to an attendant at the attraction or contact us at
          wonderlandUS@gmail.com or call (111)-111-1111.

          Parking Information
        </h2>
        <p>
          Our theme park has four parking lots, three of which are accessible for all visitors. Please see your parking options listed below!
        </p>
        
        <h3>
          Parking Zone A - Premium Parking
        </h3>
        <p>
          Parking Zone A is our premium parking area, offering shaded parking spots closest to the entrance. 
          It's the ideal choice for visitors seeking convenience and comfort. 
          While parking here comes at a premium, you'll enjoy the benefit of quick access to the park, making it perfect for those who prioritize ease of entry.
        </p>
        <p>
          Parking in this zone costs $30 per day.

        </h3>
        <p>
          Parking Zone B is our largest parking area and it's completely free! 
          Although it's not as close to the entrance as Zone A, it provides ample space for parking and is still within a 
          reasonable walking distance to the park.
        </p>

        <h3>
          Parking Zone C - Free Parking
        </h3>
        <p>
          Parking Zone C is a smaller free parking area, located slightly further from the entrance compared to Zones A and B. 
          While it may not offer as many parking spots, it's still a viable choice for visitors looking for complimentary parking options. 
        </p>

        <h3>
          Parking Zone D - Employees Only
        </h3>
        <p>
          Please note that Zone D is reserved exclusively for employees of the theme park.
